# MedEnglish Theme

This repository contains a WordPress theme for [medenglish.space](https://medenglish.space). The templates include a basic design inspired by the current site combined with a landing page layout similar to the preview on [youware.com](https://www.youware.com/project/ta165zxqf3).

## Installing the Theme

1. Copy the `medenglish-theme` folder into the `wp-content/themes` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. In the WordPress admin panel, go to **Appearance > Themes** and activate **MedEnglish Theme**.
3. Install and activate the Elementor plugin from **Plugins > Add New**.

## Customizing the Home Page

The file `front-page.php` contains a hero section with two columns, feature highlights, and a contact placeholder. Edit the template or open the page with Elementor to add your own text and images.

## Developing

You can modify the PHP templates and `style.css` to change colors or layout. Elementor provides visual controls for additional customization.
