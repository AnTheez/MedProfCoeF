# MedEnglish Theme

This repository contains a minimal WordPress theme for [medenglish.space](https://medenglish.space). The theme is designed to work with the Elementor plugin so you can customize pages visually.

## Installing the Theme

1. Copy the `medenglish-theme` folder into the `wp-content/themes` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. In the WordPress admin panel, go to **Appearance > Themes** and activate **MedEnglish Theme**.
3. Install and activate the Elementor plugin from **Plugins > Add New**.

## Customizing the Home Page

The file `front-page.php` provides a simple layout with a hero section and three feature blocks. Edit this file or use Elementor to modify the design. To recreate the layout shown on <https://www.youware.com/project/ta165zxqf3>, open the WordPress editor with Elementor and replace the content blocks accordingly.

## Developing

You can edit the PHP templates and `style.css` to adjust fonts, colors, or layout. The theme only loads a minimal stylesheet, so most visual customization can be achieved using Elementor's page builder features.
